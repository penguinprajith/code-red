# code-red project is an effort to popularize the competitve programming among young computer science engineers
# Intresting problems from different competive programming sites are collected and solved here

# users can review the code and suggest better approaches and alternatives to solve the same problems
# in a more efficient manner.

# A template folder will be used to create a template for competitive programming environment
# Most of the codes are written in C++ or Ruby programming language


#Following competitive programming sites will be included here

# 1. Leetcode
# 2. HackerRank
# 3. Kattis
# 4. CodeChef
# 5. CodinGame
# 6. CodeWars
